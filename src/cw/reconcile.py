"""Reconcile cw session state with the native Claude daemon.

A cw session is "live" if its ``surface_ref`` appears in the roster
returned by ``claude agents --json``. :func:`compute_drift` checks the
live set and returns a :class:`ReconcileReport` naming sessions whose
``surface_ref`` is absent. :func:`reconcile` applies the report.

The split is deliberate: ``compute_drift`` is pure and testable in
isolation; ``reconcile`` does the side-effecting work (state mutation,
event emission, dev-queue revert).

Transient-outage safety: ``reconcile`` refuses to mutate state when the
daemon cannot be reached (``_claude_agents_json`` raises
``CalledProcessError``) or returns an empty roster while the persisted
state still contains ACTIVE/IDLE sessions with surface refs. A transient
daemon hiccup would otherwise irreversibly mark every session as CRASHED.
``compute_drift`` stays pure and does not apply this guard.

Race note: ``reconcile`` does ``load_state → mutate → save_state`` without
a dedicated ``sessions.json`` file lock. This matches every other
``save_state`` call site in the codebase (``cw.session``, ``cw.cli``, …);
a unified state lock is a larger refactor tracked separately. In
practice the race window is the in-memory mutation between load and save,
and concurrent writers are rare in the single-user model this tool
targets.
